# Teaching Tools

Hera are some tools that I am using for teaching.

## Use _Text2qti_ to handle Canvas Quiz, homework and exams
1. Here is the [Text2qti]( https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti/tree/8e16684fe18dbcacec1474fbde8e9bfeef4c5838)  on Github.
2. There are several examples on the Github page.
3. Here are some more examples:

## Use _Vimwiki_ to generate the course html pages
1. Here is the [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) on GitHub.
2. Here are some examples:
    1. [Math 221, Fall](http://math.emory.edu/~lchen41/teaching/2020_Fall/math221_2020_Fall.html)
    1. [Math 221, Spring](http://math.emory.edu/~lchen41/teaching/2021_Spring/math221_2021_Spring.html)
3. Include the following code on Canvas syllabus page
```HTML
<p>If you cannot see the page, this might be because your browser has blocked notifications. You can turn to ``Allow". Otherwise, you can always refer the course page here</p>
<p><a href="http://math.emory.edu/~lchen41/teaching/2020_Fall/math221_2020_Fall.html">http://math.emory.edu/~lchen41/teaching/2020_Fall/math221_2020_Fall.html</a></p>
<hr>
<p><iframe id="iframeid" src="https://math.emory.edu/~lchen41/teaching/2020_Fall/math221_2020_Full.html" width="100%" height="3800"></iframe></p>
```
4. To include a iframe (youtube video) on the course page, use the following commands to post
   process your index.html file that is generated by vimwiki:
```sh
$ sed -i 's/<code>&lt;/</g' $file
$ sed -i 's/&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;<\/code>/><\/iframe>/g' $file
```
5. To generate the wordcloud on the course page, install [word_cloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) and run:
```sh
$ wordcloud_cli --text vimwiki/index.wiki --imagefile vimwiki_html/wordcloud.png
```
6. Generate the pichart for the weight, the file is using [weights.r](scripts/weights.r)
```sh
$ Rscript weights.r
```

## Use _Canvas API_ to access and handle Canvas pages.
